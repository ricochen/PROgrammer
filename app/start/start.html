  <h3>Learn how to code from beginner to a little bit better than beginner, the right way.</h3>
  <p>Too often, people who are learning to code, finish a resource and don't know what to learn next. 
  This app will provide a guideline, and steer people in the right direction by only giving one resource at a time. 
  After they finish a resource, they will be provided a test to see if they truly understand the material, if they pass they will be provided the next resource to learn.</p><br/>

  <p>"I first started learning JavaScript through CodeAcademy, but after finishing that I didn't know what to learn next.</p>
  <p>Then I came across PROgrammer. It steered me in the right direction, and made sure I understood the material before moving on.</p>
  <p>Now, I'm a PROgrammer."</p>
  <p>-Happy User</p>
