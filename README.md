# PROgrammer


## Sub-Heading ##
  Learn how to code from beginner to PROgrammer, the right way.

## Summary ##
  Too often, people who are learning to code, finish a resource and don't know what to learn next. This app will provide a guideline, and steer people in the right direction by only giving one resource/concept at a time. After they finish a resource, they will be provided a test to see if they truly understand the material, if they pass they will be provided the next resource to learn, else they will be provided a new resource on the same topic to go over, and must take a test again.

## Problem ##
  People who want to learn how to program, but have no guidance.

## Solution ##
  An app that uses accountability and provides the user with direction.

  I first started learning JavaScript through CodeAcademy, but after finishing that I didn't know what to learn next.
  Then I came across PROgrammer. It steered me in the right direction, and made sure I understood the material before moving on.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Take a bit of time to think about what you really want to do with coding. Is it a hobby? Becoming a juinor developer?
  Whatever it is, PROgrammer will adapt to fit your goals and make sure you're on the right track to achieving them.
